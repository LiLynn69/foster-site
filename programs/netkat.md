NetKAT is a network programming language based on a solid mathematical foundation: Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT). The language has a sound and complete deductive reasoning system and a decision procedure that can be used to address many practical verification problems. Probabilistic NetKAT adds new constructs for modeling randomized algorithms as well as uncertainy about traffic, failures, etc.
