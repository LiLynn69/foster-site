## OVERVIEW
The Network Programming Initiative (NPI) conducts annual Retreats to bring together faculty, students, postdocs, and industry partners for a one-day workshop with presentations, panels, and informal discussions related to network programming. Topics include practical use cases and solutions encompassing languages, algorithms and tools.

The Fall 2019 Retreat will be held on Friday, October 11, 2019 in the Tata Innovation Center at the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island. Seating is limited with preferred access to employees of NPI Sponsors. Please register here to apply to attend.

In addition to talks by NPI sponsors, faculty, postdocs and students, we are delighted to host a keynote "Democratizing the Network Edge" by our colleague Larry Peterson, CTO of the Open Networking Foundation and the Robert E. Kahn Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus at Princeton University, where he served as Chair from 2003-2009. Professor Peterson is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the ACM and the IEEE, the 2010 recipient of the IEEE Kobayashi Computer and Communication Award, and the 2013 recipient of the ACM SIGCOMM Award.

The Fall 2018 Retreat was held on Wednesday, October 3, 2018 in the Tata Innovation Center at the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island. Participation was by invitation only.
