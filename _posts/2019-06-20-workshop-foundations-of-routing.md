## OVERVIEW
A common objective in many computer networks is to balance traffic across multiple paths in order to improve throughput, reduce congestion, and achieve higher utilization. But while there is an extensive theoretical literature on how best to route traffic through a capacitated network, many networks today rely on schemes that are easy to implement but do not perform well in practice.

This workshop will bring together leading researchers and industrial practitioners from the theory and networking communities to discuss recent successes and future challenges related to routing.
